**DanmakuBenchmark** is a Unity benchmark project that compares the performance
of the Mesh APIs: The "simple" API vs. the "advanced" API.

I have modified the original project so that it tries to maintain a consistent bullet count, as opposed to maintaining a consistent frame rate. I have also made it easier to compare the simple/advanced APIs by allowing the user to press space to toggle between them.
